# To-Do-List

In this project, I aim to create a To do List application.
 [Website link](https://halilibrahimcelik.github.io/To-Do-List/).

I adopted Bootstrap templates and   for styling extra features, I  used SASS.
In my project I mainly manipulated form and button elements via javaScript. 

*********************************
You can add and remove your priorities. 
You can drag lists and re-organize your application  as you like.
You can also edit the list items once you added to the your task list.
Yo can also sort the list items after you make any chances on the list.
